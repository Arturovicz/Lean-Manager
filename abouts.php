		<h1>About Lean Manager</h1>
		<p><span class="highlight">Lean Manager</span> 
		is a project that combines the power of SQL and PHP to create a full-blown application for managing orders
		and contributing to the continuous improvement of a company. With Lean Manager, users can easily create and 
		manage orders, track their progress through various stages of processing, and identify any industrial defaults
		that occur during the process. By collecting data on these defaults, Lean Manager helps companies identify areas
		for improvement and implement changes to increase efficiency and reduce waste. The application is designed to be
		user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to all members of a team, regardless of their technical background.
		Lean Manager is a powerful tool for companies looking to streamline their operations and optimize their processes for
		maximum productivity and profitability.
